Nathalie Cabrol	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=1	Planetary explorer	How Mars might hold the secret to the origin of life	134,914	16:02	While we like to imagine little green men, it’s far more likely that life on other planets will be microbial. Planetary scientist Nathalie Cabrol takes us inside the search for microbes on Mars, a hunt which counterintuitively leads us to the remote lakes of the Andes mountains. This extreme environment — with its thin atmosphere and scorched land — approximates the surface of Mars about 3.5 billion years ago. How microbes adapt to survive here may just show us where to look on Mars — and could help us understand why some microbial pathways lead to civilization while others are a dead end.

Marc Kushner	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=1	Architect	Why the buildings of the future will be shaped by ... you	1,069,903	18:05	"Architecture is not about math or zoning — it's about visceral emotions," says Marc Kushner. In a sweeping — often funny — talk, he zooms through the past thirty years of architecture to show how the public, once disconnected, have become an essential part of the design process.

Think again	905,009	12:09	Sending an email message is like sending a postcard, says scientist Andy Yen in this thought-provoking talk: Anyone can read it. Yet encryption, the technology that protects the privacy of email communication, does exist. It's just that until now it has been difficult to install and a hassle to use. Showing a demo of an email program he designed with colleagues at CERN, Yen argues that encryption can be made simple to the point of becoming the default option, providing true email privacy to all.

Carol Dweck	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=3	Psychologist	The power of believing that you can improve	2,546,468	10:20	Carol Dweck researches “growth mindset” — the idea that we can grow our brain's capacity to learn and to solve problems. In this talk, she describes two ways to think about a problem that’s slightly too hard for you to solve. Are you not smart enough to solve it … or have you just not solved it yet? A great introduction to this influential field.
Jeremy Howard	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=3	Data scientist	The wonderful and terrifying implications of computers that can learn	1,232,345	19:45	What happens when we teach a computer how to learn? Technologist Jeremy Howard shares some surprising new developments in the fast-moving field of deep learning, a technique that can give computers the ability to learn Chinese, or to recognize objects in photos, or to help think through a medical diagnosis. (One deep learning tool, after watching hours of YouTube, taught itself the concept of “cats.”) Get caught up on a field that will change the way the computers around you behave … sooner than you probably think.

Walk boldly toward them	878,059	17:49	Our biases can be dangerous, even deadly — as we've seen in the cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner, in Staten Island, New York. Diversity advocate Vernā Myers looks closely at some of the subconscious attitudes we hold toward out-groups. She makes a plea to all people: Acknowledge your biases. Then move toward, not away from, the groups that make you uncomfortable. In a funny, impassioned, important talk, she shows us how.
Dave Troy	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=3	Technologist	Social maps that reveal a city's intersections — and separations	1,100,025	5:28	Every city has its neighborhoods, cliques and clubs, the hidden lines that join and divide people in the same town. What can we learn about cities by looking at what people share online? Starting with his own home town of Baltimore, Dave Troy has been visualizing what the tweets of city dwellers reveal about who lives there, who they talk to — and who they don’t.
Catherine Crump	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=3	Attorney + privacy advocate	The small and surprisingly dangerous detail the police track about you	1,401,242	5:54	A very unsexy-sounding piece of technology could mean that the police know where you go, with whom, and when: the automatic license plate reader. These cameras are innocuously placed all across small-town America to catch known criminals, but as lawyer and TED Fellow Catherine Crump shows, the data they collect in aggregate could have disastrous consequences for everyone the world over.
Thomas Hellum	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=3	Slow television advocate	The world's most boring television ... and why it's hilariously addictive	1,514,263	18:06	You've heard about slow food.

Rainer Strack	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=3	Human resources expert	The workforce crisis of 2030 — and how to start solving it now	1,086,298	12:47	It sounds counterintuitive, but by 2030, many of the world's largest economies will have more jobs than adult citizens to do those jobs. In this data-filled — and quite charming — talk, human resources expert Rainer Strack suggests that countries ought to look across borders for mobile and willing job seekers. But to do that, they need to start by changing the culture in their businesses.
Ben Saunders	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=3	Arctic explorer	To the South Pole and back — the hardest 105 days of my life	761,402	17:04	This year, explorer Ben Saunders attempted his most ambitious trek yet.

Leana Wen	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=3	Emergency physician, public health advocate	What your doctor won’t disclose	1,239,287	15:42	Wouldn’t you want to know if your doctor was a paid spokesman for a drug company?

Michael Green	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=3	Social progress expert	What the Social Progress Index can reveal about your country	895,016	14:56	The term Gross Domestic Product is often talked about as if it were “handed down from god on tablets of stone.” But this concept was invented by an economist in the 1930s. We need a more effective measurement tool to match 21st century needs, says Michael Green: the Social Progress Index. With charm and wit, he shows how this tool measures societies across the three dimensions that actually matter. And reveals the dramatic reordering of nations that occurs when you use it.
Ramanan Laxminarayan	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=3	Drug-resistance economist	The coming crisis in antibiotics	753,748	14:42	Antibiotic drugs save lives. But we simply use them too much — and often for non-lifesaving purposes, like treating the flu and even raising cheaper chickens. The result, says researcher Ramanan Laxminarayan, is that the drugs will stop working for everyone, as the bacteria they target grow more and more resistant. He calls on all of us (patients and doctors alike) to think of antibiotics — and their ongoing effectiveness — as a finite resource, and to think twice before we tap into it. It’s a sobering look at how global medical trends can strike home.

Bring the community into the process	920,400	15:49	When asked to build housing for 100 families in Chile ten years ago, Alejandro Aravena looked to an unusual inspiration: the wisdom of favelas and slums.

Sharing examples from her hometown of Rio, she says: "It is up to us to decide whether we want schools or parking lots, recycling projects or construction sites, cars or buses, loneliness or solidarity."
Jeremy Heimans	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=3	Activist	What new power looks like	1,104,128	15:08	We can see the power of distributed, crowd-sourced business models every day — witness Uber, Kickstarter, Airbnb.

It’s a bold argument about the future of politics and power; watch and see if you agree.

Sergei Lupashin	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=4	Aerial robotics researcher	A flying camera ... on a leash	1,038,712	6:23	Let's admit it: aerial photo drones and UAVs are a little creepy, and they come with big regulatory and safety problems. But aerial photos can be a powerful way of telling the truth about the world: the size of a protest, the spread of an oil spill, the wildlife hidden in a delta. Sergei Lupashin demos Fotokite, a nifty new way to see the world from on high, safely and under control.
Kimberley Motley	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=4	International litigator	How I defend the rule of law	755,878	15:26	Every human deserves protection under their country’s laws — even when that law is forgotten or ignored.

So let’s print it.	686,000	14:24	During the financial crisis, the central banks of the United States, United Kingdom and Japan created $3.7 trillion in order to buy assets and encourage investors to do the same. Michael Metcalfe offers a shocking idea: could these same central banks print money to ensure they stay on track with their goals for global aid? Without risking inflation?
Catherine Bracy	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=8	Hacker, community manager	Why good hackers make good citizens	757,336	9:50	Hacking is about more than mischief-making or political subversion. As Catherine Bracy describes in this spirited talk, it can be just as much a force for good as it is for evil. She spins through some inspiring civically-minded projects in Honolulu, Oakland and Mexico City — and makes a compelling case that we all have what it takes to get involved.
Siddharthan Chandran	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=8	Regenerative neurologist	Can the damaged brain repair itself?	799,782	15:57	After a traumatic brain injury, it sometimes happens that the brain can repair itself, building new brain cells to replace damaged ones. But the repair doesn't happen quickly enough to allow recovery from degenerative conditions like motor neuron disease (also known as Lou Gehrig's disease or ALS). Siddharthan Chandran walks through some new techniques using special stem cells that could allow the damaged brain to rebuild faster.
Ash Beckham	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=8	Equality advocate	We're all hiding something. Let's find the courage to open up	2,145,299	9:22	In this touching talk, Ash Beckham offers a fresh approach to empathy and openness. It starts with understanding that everyone, at some point in their life, has experienced hardship. The only way out, says Beckham, is to open the door and step out of your closet.
Christopher Ryan	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=8	Psychologist	Are we designed to be sexual omnivores?	1,608,723	14:02	An idea permeates our modern view of relationships: that men and women have always paired off in sexually exclusive relationships. But before the dawn of agriculture, humans may actually have been quite promiscuous. Author Christopher Ryan walks us through the controversial evidence that human beings are sexual omnivores by nature, in hopes that a more nuanced understanding may put an end to discrimination, shame and the kind of unrealistic expectations that kill relationships.

Rupal Patel	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=8	Speech scientist	Synthetic voices, as unique as fingerprints	754,399	11:44	Many of those with severe speech disorders use a computerized device to communicate. Yet they choose between only a few voice options. That's why Stephen Hawking has an American accent, and why many people end up with the same voice, often to incongruous effect. Speech scientist Rupal Patel wanted to do something about this, and in this wonderful talk she shares her work to engineer unique voices for the voiceless.
Chris McKnett	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=8	Sustainable investment champion	The investment logic for sustainability	775,407	12:19	Sustainability is pretty clearly one of the world's most important goals; but what groups can really make environmental progress in leaps and bounds? Chris McKnett makes the case that it's large institutional investors. He shows how strong financial data isn't enough, and reveals why investors need to look at a company's environmental, social and governance structures, too.
Leyla Acaroglu	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=8	Sustainability strategist	Paper beats plastic? How to rethink environmental folklore	1,009,327	18:07	Most of us want to do the right thing when it comes to the environment.

Dan Berkenstock	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=9	Satellite designer	The world is one big dataset. Now, how to photograph it ...	764,086	9:44	We're all familiar with satellite imagery, but what we might not know is that much of it is out of date. That's because satellites are big and expensive, so there aren't that many of them up in space. As he explains in this fascinating talk, Dan Berkenstock and his team came up with a different solution, designing a cheap, lightweight satellite with a radically new approach to photographing what's going on on Earth.
Esta Soler	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=9	Violence and abuse prevention expert	How we turned the tide on domestic violence (Hint: the Polaroid helped)	939,937	11:10	When Esta Soler lobbied for a bill outlawing domestic violence in 1984, one politician called it the "Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act."

Nicolas Perony	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=9	Animal scientist	Puppies! Now that I’ve got your attention, complexity theory	798,457	13:45	Animal behavior isn't complicated, but it is complex. Nicolas Perony studies how individual animals — be they Scottish Terriers, bats or meerkats — follow simple rules that, collectively, create larger patterns of behavior. And how this complexity born of simplicity can help them adapt to new circumstances, as they arise.
McKenna Pope	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=9	Teen activist	Want to be an activist? Start with your toys	755,321	5:22	McKenna Pope's younger brother loved to cook, but he worried about using an Easy-Bake Oven — because it was a toy for girls. So at age 13, Pope started an online petition for the American toy company Hasbro to change the pink-and-purple color scheme on the classic toy and incorporate boys into its TV marketing. In a heartening talk, Pope makes the case for gender-neutral toys and gives a rousing call to action to all kids who feel powerless.
Anne Milgram	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=9	VP criminal justice, Arnold Foundation	Why smart statistics are the key to fighting crime	691,243	12:41	When she became the attorney general of New Jersey in 2007, Anne Milgram quickly discovered a few startling facts: not only did her team not really know who they were putting in jail, but they had no way of understanding if their decisions were actually making the public safer. And so began her ongoing, inspirational quest to bring data analytics and statistical analysis to the US criminal justice system.
Anant Agarwal	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=9	Education innovator	Why massive open online courses (still) matter	807,251	15:19	2013 was a year of hype for MOOCs (massive open online courses). Great big numbers and great big hopes were followed by some disappointing first results. But the head of edX, Anant Agarwal, makes the case that MOOCs still matter — as a way to share high-level learning widely and supplement (but perhaps not replace) traditional classrooms. Agarwal shares his vision of blended learning, where teachers create the ideal learning experience for 21st century students.
Joe Kowan	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=9	Musician and graphic designer	How I beat stage fright	1,899,736	8:03	Humanity's fine-tuned sense of fear served us well as a young species, giving us laser focus to avoid being eaten by competing beasts. But it's less wonderful when that same visceral, body-hijacking sense of fear kicks in in front of 20 folk-music fans at a Tuesday night open-mic. Palms sweat, hands shake, vision blurs, and the brain says RUN: it's stage fright. In this charming, tuneful little talk, Joe Kowan talks about how he conquered it.
Yves Morieux	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=9	Consultant	As work gets more complex, 6 rules to simplify	2,290,602	12:01	Why do people feel so miserable and disengaged at work? Because today's businesses are increasingly and dizzyingly complex — and traditional pillars of management are obsolete, says Yves Morieux. So, he says, it falls to individual employees to navigate the rabbit's warren of interdependencies. In this energetic talk, Morieux offers six rules for "smart simplicity." (Rule One: Understand what your colleagues actually do.)
Paula Johnson	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=9	Women's-health expert	His and hers … healthcare	937,188	14:42	Every cell in the human body has a sex, which means that men and women are different right down to the cellular level. Yet too often, research and medicine ignore this insight — and the often startlingly different ways in which the two sexes respond to disease or treatment. As pioneering doctor Paula Johnson describes in this thought-provoking talk, lumping everyone in together means we essentially leave women's health to chance. It's time to rethink.
Shereen El Feki	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=9	Arab sexuality expert	A little-told tale of sex and sensuality	1,414,531	16:10	“If you really want to know a people, start by looking inside their bedrooms," says Shereen El Feki, who traveled through the Middle East for five years, talking to people about sex. While those conversations reflected rigid norms and deep repression, El Feki also discovered that sexual conservatism in the Arab world is a relatively new thing. She wonders: could a re-emergence of public dialogue lead to more satisfying, and safer, sex lives?
Guy Hoffman	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=9	Roboticist	Robots with "soul"	2,630,110	17:38	What kind of robots does an animator / jazz musician / roboticist make? Playful, reactive, curious ones.

Krista Donaldson	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=9	Engineer	The $80 prosthetic knee that's changing lives	787,389	9:55	We've made incredible advances in technology in recent years, but too often it seems only certain fortunate people can benefit. Engineer Krista Donaldson introduces the ReMotion knee, a prosthetic device for above-knee amputees, many of whom earn less than $4 a day. The design contains best-in-class technology and yet is far cheaper than other prosthetics on the market.
Andrew Solomon	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=9	Writer	Depression, the secret we share	3,925,872	29:21	"The opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality, and it was vitality that seemed to seep away from me in that moment." In a talk equal parts eloquent and devastating, writer Andrew Solomon takes you to the darkest corners of his mind during the years he battled depression. That led him to an eye-opening journey across the world to interview others with depression — only to discover that, to his surprise, the more he talked, the more people wanted to tell their own stories. (Filmed at TEDxMet.)
Marco Annunziata	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=9	Economist	Welcome to the age of the industrial internet	1,254,921	12:36	Everyone's talking about the "Internet of Things," but what exactly does that mean for our future? In this thoughtful talk, economist Marco Annunziata looks at how technology is transforming the industrial sector, creating machines that can see, feel, sense and react — so they can be operated far more efficiently. Think: airplane parts that send an alert when they need to be serviced, or wind turbines that communicate with one another to generate more electricity. It's a future with exciting implications for us all.
Toni Griffin	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=9	Place maker	A new vision for rebuilding Detroit	739,036	11:48	Once the powerhouse of America's industrial might, Detroit is more recently known in the popular imagination as a fabulous ruin, crumbling and bankrupt. But city planner Toni Griffin asks us to look again — and to imagine an entrepreneurial future for the city's 700,000 residents.
Rose George	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=9	Curious journalist	Inside the secret shipping industry	1,245,588	11:23	Almost everything we own and use, at some point, travels to us by container ship, through a vast network of ocean routes and ports that most of us know almost nothing about. Journalist Rose George tours us through the world of shipping, the underpinning of consumer civilization.
Stephen Cave	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=9	Philosopher	The 4 stories we tell ourselves about death	1,869,857	15:33	Philosopher Stephen Cave begins with a dark but compelling question: When did you first realize you were going to die? And even more interesting: Why do we humans so often resist the inevitability of death? Cave explores four narratives — common across civilizations — that we tell ourselves "in order to help us manage the terror of death."
Eddy Cartaya	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=9	Cave Explorer	My glacier cave discoveries	533,987	8:02	Snow Dragon. Pure Imagination. Frozen Minotaur. These are the names Eddy Cartaya and his climbing partner Brent McGregor gave three glacier caves that they were the first to explore. As the Sandy Glacier slowly slides down Mount Hood in Oregon, the caves and tunnels inside it morph annually thanks to warm water from above and warm air from below. At TEDYouth, Cartaya takes us inside these magical spaces where the ice glows in bright blues and greens, and where artifacts rain from the ceiling.
Diébédo Francis Kéré	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=9	Community-minded architect	How to build with clay... and community	746,727	12:11	Diébédo Francis Kéré knew exactly what he wanted to do when he got his degree in architecture… He wanted to go home to Gando in Burkina Faso, to help his neighbors reap the benefit of his education. In this charming talk, Kéré shows off some of the beautiful structures he's helped to build in his small village in the years since then, including an award-winning primary school made from clay by the entire community.
Boyd Varty	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=9	Environmental and literacy activist	What I learned from Nelson Mandela	1,431,056	14:59	"In the cathedral of the wild, we get to see the best parts of ourselves reflected back to us." Boyd Varty, a wildlife activist, shares stories of animals, humans and their interrelatedness, or "ubuntu" — defined as, "I am, because of you." And he dedicates the talk to South African leader Nelson Mandela, the human embodiment of that same great-hearted, generous spirit.
Enrique Peñalosa	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=9	Colombian politician, urban activist	Why buses represent democracy in action	752,521	14:17	"An advanced city is not one where even the poor use cars, but rather one where even the rich use public transport," argues Enrique Peñalosa. In this spirited talk, the former mayor of Bogotá shares some of the tactics he used to change the transportation dynamic in the Colombian capital... and suggests ways to think about building smart cities of the future.
David Lang	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=9	Maker	My underwater robot	1,085,083	4:28	David Lang is a maker who taught himself to become an amateur oceanographer — or, he taught a robot to be one for him. In a charming talk Lang, a TED Fellow, shows how he and a network of ocean lovers teamed up to build open-sourced, low-cost underwater explorers.
Sally Kohn	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Political pundit	Let’s try emotional correctness	1,472,852	5:59	It's time for liberals and conservatives to transcend their political differences and really listen to each other, says political pundit Sally Kohn. In this optimistic talk, Kohn shares what she learned as a progressive lesbian talking head on Fox News. It’s not about political correctness, she says, but rather, emotional correctness. (Contains profanity.)
Geraldine Hamilton	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Bio researcher	Body parts on a chip	1,303,489	13:23	It's relatively easy to imagine a new medicine, a better cure for some disease. The hard part, though, is testing it, and that can delay promising new cures for years. In this well-explained talk, Geraldine Hamilton shows how her lab creates organs and body parts on a chip, simple structures with all the pieces essential to testing new medications — even custom cures for one specific person. (Filmed at TEDxBoston)
Toby Eccles	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Social investment visionary	Invest in social change	810,356	10:03	Here's a stat worth knowing: In the UK, 63% of men who finish short-term prison sentences are back inside within a year for another crime. Helping them stay outside involves job training, classes, therapy. And it would pay off handsomely — but the government can't find the funds. Toby Eccles shares an imaginative idea for how to change that: the Social Impact Bond. It's an unusual bond that helps fund initiatives with a social goal through private money — with the government paying back the investors (with interest) if the initiatives work.
David Steindl-Rast	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Monk	Want to be happy? Be grateful	4,306,315	14:30	The one thing all humans have in common is that each of us wants to be happy, says Brother David Steindl-Rast, a monk and interfaith scholar. And happiness, he suggests, is born from gratitude. An inspiring lesson in slowing down, looking where you’re going, and above all, being grateful.
Suzana Herculano-Houzel	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Neuroscientist	What is so special about the human brain?	1,614,188	13:31	The human brain is puzzling — it is curiously large given the size of our bodies, uses a tremendous amount of energy for its weight and has a bizarrely dense cerebral cortex. But: why? Neuroscientist Suzana Herculano-Houzel puts on her detective's cap and leads us through this mystery. By making "brain soup," she arrives at a startling conclusion.
Jared Diamond	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Civilization scholar	How societies can grow old better	779,431	18:11	There's an irony behind the latest efforts to extend human life: It's no picnic to be an old person in a youth-oriented society. Older people can become isolated, lacking meaningful work and low on funds. In this intriguing talk, Jared Diamond looks at how many different societies treat their elders — some better, some worse — and suggests we all take advantage of experience.
Peter Doolittle	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Educational psychology professor	How your "working memory" makes sense of the world	1,594,546	9:29	"Life comes at us very quickly, and what we need to do is take that amorphous flow of experience and somehow extract meaning from it." In this funny, enlightening talk, educational psychologist Peter Doolittle details the importance — and limitations — of your "working memory," that part of the brain that allows us to make sense of what's happening right now.
Andreas Raptopoulos	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Airborne logistics activist	No roads? There’s a drone for that	856,068	9:13	A billion people in the world lack access to all-season roads. Could the structure of the internet provide a model for how to reach them? Andreas Raptopoulos of Matternet thinks so. He introduces a new type of transportation system that uses electric autonomous flying machines to deliver medicine, food, goods and supplies wherever they are needed.
Henry Evans	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Robotics activist	Meet the robots for humanity	1,099,121	10:21	Paralyzed by a stroke, Henry Evans uses a telepresence robot to take the stage — and show how new robotics, tweaked and personalized by a group called Robots for Humanity, help him live his life. He shows off a nimble little quadrotor drone, created by a team led by Chad Jenkins, that gives him the ability to navigate space — to once again look around a garden, stroll a campus … (Filmed at TEDxMidAtlantic.)
Greg Asner	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Airborne ecologist	Ecology from the air	579,858	13:50	What are our forests really made of? From the air, ecologist Greg Asner uses a spectrometer and high-powered lasers to map nature in meticulous kaleidoscopic 3D detail — what he calls “a very high-tech accounting system” of carbon. In this fascinating talk, Asner gives a clear message: To save our ecosystems, we need more data, gathered in new ways.
Lian Pin Koh	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Drones ecologist	A drone's-eye view of conservation	533,693	13:30	Ecologist Lian Pin Koh makes a persuasive case for using drones to protect the world's forests and wildlife. These lightweight autonomous flying vehicles can track animals in their natural habitat, monitor the health of rainforests, even combat crime by detecting poachers via thermal imaging. Added bonus? They're also entirely affordable.
Jane McGonigal	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Game Designer	Massively multi-player… thumb-wrestling?	1,042,075	7:18	What happens when you get an entire audience to stand up and connect with one another? Chaos, that's what. At least, that's what happened when Jane McGonigal tried to teach TED to play her favorite game. Then again, when the game is "massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling," what else would you expect?
Stefan Larsson	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Value-based health care advocate	What doctors can learn from each other	789,404	12:56	Different hospitals produce different results on different procedures. Only, patients don’t know that data, making choosing a surgeon a high-stakes guessing game. Stefan Larsson looks at what happens when doctors measure and share their outcomes on hip replacement surgery, for example, to see which techniques are proving the most effective. Could health care get better — and cheaper — if doctors learn from each other in a continuous feedback loop?
Mohamed Ali	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Human rights advocate	The link between unemployment and terrorism	870,456	9:01	For the young and unemployed in the world's big cities, dreams of opportunity and wealth do come true — but too often because they're heavily recruited by terrorist groups and other violent organizations. Human rights advocate Mohamed Ali draws on stories from his native Mogadishu to make a powerful case for innovation incubators for our cities' young and ambitious.
Chris Downey	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Architect	Design with the blind in mind	860,989	11:40	What would a city designed for the blind be like? Chris Downey is an architect who went suddenly blind in 2008; he contrasts life in his beloved San Francisco before and after — and shows how the thoughtful designs that enhance his life now might actually make everyone's life better, sighted or not.
Dambisa Moyo	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Global economist	Is China the new idol for emerging economies?	1,702,649	16:23	The developed world holds up the ideals of capitalism, democracy and political rights for all. Those in emerging markets often don't have that luxury. In this powerful talk, economist Dambisa Moyo makes the case that the west can't afford to rest on its laurels and imagine others will blindly follow. Instead, a different model, embodied by China, is increasingly appealing. A call for open-minded political and economic cooperation in the name of transforming the world.
Arthur Benjamin	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Mathemagician	The magic of Fibonacci numbers	2,771,716	6:24	Math is logical, functional and just ... awesome. Mathemagician Arthur Benjamin explores hidden properties of that weird and wonderful set of numbers, the Fibonacci series. (And reminds you that mathematics can be inspiring, too!)
Mikko Hypponen	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Cybersecurity expert	How the NSA betrayed the world's trust — time to act	1,317,618	19:18	Recent events have highlighted, underlined and bolded the fact that the United States is performing blanket surveillance on any foreigner whose data passes through an American entity — whether they are suspected of wrongdoing or not. This means that, essentially, every international user of the internet is being watched, says Mikko Hypponen. An important rant, wrapped with a plea: to find alternative solutions to using American companies for the world's information needs.
Grégoire Courtine	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Spinal cord researcher	The paralyzed rat that walked	734,087	14:23	A spinal cord injury can sever the communication between your brain and your body, leading to paralysis. Fresh from his lab, Grégoire Courtine shows a new method — combining drugs, electrical stimulation and a robot — that could re-awaken the neural pathways and help the body learn again to move on its own. See how it works, as a paralyzed rat becomes able to run and navigate stairs.
Robin Nagle	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Trash anthropologist	What I discovered in New York City trash	1,486,818	7:52	New York City residents produce 11,000 tons of garbage every day. Every day! This astonishing statistic is just one of the reasons Robin Nagle started a research project with the city's Department of Sanitation. She walked the routes, operated mechanical brooms, even drove a garbage truck herself—all so she could answer a simple-sounding but complicated question: who cleans up after us?
Rodrigo Canales	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Business professor	The deadly genius of drug cartels	1,902,655	17:56	Up to 100,000 people died in drug-related violence in Mexico in the last 6 years. We might think this has nothing to do with us, but in fact we are all complicit, says Yale professor Rodrigo Canales in this unflinching talk that turns conventional wisdom about drug cartels on its head. The carnage is not about faceless, ignorant goons mindlessly killing each other but is rather the result of some seriously sophisticated brand management.
Dong Woo Jang	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Bow designer	The art of bow-making	1,545,886	8:28	Dong Woo Jang has an unusual after school hobby. Jang, who was 15 when he gave the talk, tells the story of how living in the concrete jungle of Seoul inspired him to build the perfect bow. Watch him demo one of his beautiful hand-crafted archer's bows.
Holly Morris	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Explorer and filmmaker	Why stay in Chernobyl? Because it's home.	1,009,646	8:51	Chernobyl was the site of the world's worst nuclear accident and, for the past 27 years, the area around the plant has been known as the Exclusion Zone. And yet, a community of about 200 people live there — almost all of them elderly women. These proud grandmas defied orders to relocate because their connection to their homeland and to their community are "forces that rival even radiation."
Abha Dawesar	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Novelist	Life in the "digital now"	1,055,207	12:01	One year ago, Abha Dawesar was living in blacked-out Manhattan post-Sandy, scrounging for power to connect. As a novelist, she was struck by this metaphor: Have our lives now become fixated on the drive to digitally connect, while we miss out on what's real?
Mohamed Hijri	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Biologist	A simple solution to the coming phosphorus crisis	545,686	13:41	Biologist Mohamed Hijri brings to light a farming crisis no one is talking about: We are running out of phosphorus, an essential element that's a key component of DNA and the basis of cellular communication. All roads of this crisis lead back to how we farm — with chemical fertilizers chock-full of the element, which plants are not efficient at absorbing. One solution? Perhaps … a microscopic mushroom. (Filmed at TEDxUdeM.)
Mariana Mazzucato	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Innovation economist	Government — investor, risk-taker, innovator	653,745	14:04	Why doesn’t the government just get out of the way and let the private sector — the “real revolutionaries” — innovate? It’s rhetoric you hear everywhere, and Mariana Mazzucato wants to dispel it. In an energetic talk, she shows how the state — which many see as a slow, hunkering behemoth — is really one of our most exciting risk-takers and market-shapers.
Xavier Vilalta	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Architect and urbanist	Architecture at home in its community	914,943	7:44	When TED Fellow Xavier Vilalta was commissioned to create a multistory shopping mall in Addis Ababa, he panicked. Other centers represented everything he hated about contemporary architecture: wasteful, glass towers requiring tons of energy whose design had absolutely nothing to do with Africa. In this charming talk, Vilalta shows how he champions an alternative approach: to harness nature, reference design tradition and create beautiful, modern, iconic buildings fit for a community.
Gian Giudice	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Theoretical physicist	Why our universe might exist on a knife-edge	1,178,067	14:10	The biggest surprise of discovering the Higgs boson? That there were no surprises. Gian Giudice talks us through a problem in theoretical physics: what if the Higgs field exists in an ultra-dense state that could mean the collapse of all atomic matter? With wit and charm, Giudice outlines a grim fate — and why we shouldn't start worrying just yet.
Parul Sehgal	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Literary critic	An ode to envy	1,697,681	13:11	What is jealousy? What drives it, and why do we secretly love it? No study has ever been able to capture its “loneliness, longevity, grim thrill” — that is, says Parul Sehgal, except for fiction. In an eloquent meditation she scours pages from literature to show how jealousy is not so different from a quest for knowledge.
Charles Robertson	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Emerging-markets economist	Africa's next boom	1,056,078	11:33	The past decade has seen slow and steady economic growth across the continent of Africa. But economist Charles Robertson has a bold thesis: Africa's about to boom. He talks through a few of the indicators — from rising education levels to expanded global investment (and not just from China) — that lead him to predict rapid growth for a billion people, sooner than you may think.
Steve Howard	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Corporate innovator	Let's go all-in on selling sustainability	868,587	13:18	The big blue buildings of Ikea have sprouted solar panels and wind turbines; inside, shelves are stocked with LED lighting and recycled cotton. Why? Because as Steve Howard puts it: “Sustainability has gone from a nice-to-do to a must-do.” Howard, the chief sustainability officer at the furniture megastore, talks about his quest to sell eco-friendly materials and practices — both internally and to worldwide customers — and lays a challenge for other global giants.
Hetain Patel and Yuyu Rau	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Artist	Who am I? Think again	2,403,006	9:06	How do we decide who we are? Hetain Patel's surprising performance plays with identity, language and accent — and challenges you to think deeper than surface appearances. A delightful meditation on self, with performer Yuyu Rau, and inspired by Bruce Lee.
Alessandro Acquisti	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Privacy economist	What will a future without secrets look like?	1,102,788	15:00	The line between public and private has blurred in the past decade, both online and in real life, and Alessandro Acquisti is here to explain what this means and why it matters. In this thought-provoking, slightly chilling talk, he shares details of recent and ongoing research — including a project that shows how easy it is to match a photograph of a stranger with their sensitive personal information.
Iwan Baan	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Urban documentarian	Ingenious homes in unexpected places	1,242,464	16:58	In the center of Caracas, Venezuela, stands the 45-story "Tower of David," an unfinished, abandoned skyscraper. But about eight years ago, people started moving in. Photographer Iwan Baan shows how people build homes in unlikely places, touring us through the family apartments of Torre David, a city on the water in Nigeria, and an underground village in China. Glorious images celebrate humanity's ability to survive and make a home — anywhere.
Amanda Bennett	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Journalist	We need a heroic narrative for death	776,816	15:24	Amanda Bennett and her husband were passionate and full of life all throughout their lives together — and up until the final days, too. Bennett gives a sweet yet powerful talk on why, for the loved ones of the dying, having hope for a happy ending shouldn't warrant a diagnosis of "denial." She calls for a more heroic narrative for death — to match the ones we have in life.
Jeff Speck	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=10	Urban planner	The walkable city	842,732	16:56	How do we solve the problem of the suburbs? Urbanist Jeff Speck shows how we can free ourselves from dependence on the car — which he calls "a gas-belching, time-wasting, life-threatening prosthetic device" — by making our cities more walkable and more pleasant for more people.
Andrew Fitzgerald	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Editor	Adventures in Twitter fiction	921,625	11:55	In the 1930s, broadcast radio introduced an entirely new form of storytelling; today, micro-blogging platforms like Twitter are changing the scene again. Andrew Fitzgerald takes a look at the (aptly) short but fascinating history of new forms of creative experimentation in fiction and storytelling.
Gary Slutkin	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Epidemiologist	Let's treat violence like a contagious disease	657,519	14:08	Physician Gary Slutkin spent a decade fighting tuberculosis, cholera and AIDS epidemics in Africa. When he returned to the United States, he thought he'd escape brutal epidemic deaths. But then he began to look more carefully at gun violence, noting that its spread followed the patterns of infectious diseases. A mind-flipping look at a problem that too many communities have accepted as a given. We've reversed the impact of so many diseases, says Slutkin, and we can do the same with violence. (Filmed at TEDMED.)
Trita Parsi	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Political scientist	Iran and Israel: Peace is possible	655,325	10:45	Iran and Israel: two nations with tense relations that seem existentially at odds. But for all their antagonistic rhetoric, there is a recent hidden history of collaboration, even friendship. In an informative talk, Trita Parsi shows how an unlikely strategic alliance in the past could mean peace in the future for these two feuding countries.
Janette Sadik-Khan	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	City transportation expert	New York's streets? Not so mean any more	812,043	14:02	In this funny and thought-provoking talk, Janette Sadik-Khan, transportation commissioner of New York City, shares projects that have reshaped street life in the 5 boroughs, including pedestrian zones in Times Square, high-performance buses and a 6,000-cycle-strong bike share. Her mantra: Do bold experiments that are cheap to try out.
Michael Sandel	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Political philosopher	Why we shouldn't trust markets with our civic life	1,394,593	14:37	In the past three decades, says Michael Sandel, the US has drifted from a market economy to a market society; it's fair to say that an American's experience of shared civic life depends on how much money they have. (Three key examples: access to education, access to justice, political influence.) In a talk and audience discussion, Sandel asks us to think honestly on this question: In our current democracy, is too much for sale?
Michael Porter	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Business strategist	Why business can be good at solving social problems	1,135,249	16:28	Why do we turn to nonprofits, NGOs and governments to solve society's biggest problems? Michael Porter admits he's biased, as a business school professor, but he wants you to hear his case for letting business try to solve massive problems like climate change and access to water. Why? Because when business solves a problem, it makes a profit — which lets that solution grow.
Jason Pontin	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Editor	Can technology solve our big problems?	1,412,579	10:03	In 1969, Buzz Aldrin’s historical step onto the moon leapt mankind into an era of technological possibility. The awesome power of technology was to be used to solve all of our big problems. Fast forward to present day, and what's happened? Are mobile apps all we have to show for ourselves? Journalist Jason Pontin looks closely at the challenges we face to using technology effectively ... for problems that really matter.
Fabian Oefner	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Photographer	Psychedelic science	1,532,851	12:05	Swiss artist and photographer Fabian Oefner is on a mission to make eye-catching art from everyday science. In this charming talk, he shows off some recent psychedelic images, including photographs of crystals as they interact with soundwaves. And, in a live demo, he shows what really happens when you mix paint with magnetic liquid—or when you set fire to whiskey.
Amy Webb	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Digital strategist	How I hacked online dating	3,958,323	17:27	Amy Webb was having no luck with online dating. The dates she liked didn't write her back, and her own profile attracted crickets (and worse). So, as any fan of data would do: she started making a spreadsheet. Hear the story of how she went on to hack her online dating life — with frustrating, funny and life-changing results.
Kelli Swazey	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Anthropologist	Life that doesn't end with death	1,375,938	13:54	In Tana Toraja, weddings and births aren’t the social gatherings that knit society together. In this part of Indonesia, big, raucous funerals form the center of social life. Anthropologist Kelli Swazey takes a look at this culture, in which the bodies of dead relatives are cared for even years after they have passed. While it sounds strange to Western sensibilities, she says, this could actually be a truer reflection of the fact that relationships with loved ones don’t simply end when breathing does. (Filmed at TEDMED.)
Malcolm Gladwell	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Writer	The unheard story of David and Goliath	2,323,300	15:40	It's a classic underdog tale: David, a young shepherd armed only with a sling, beats Goliath, the mighty warrior. The story has transcended its biblical origins to become a common shorthand for unlikely victory. But, asks Malcolm Gladwell, is that really what the David and Goliath story is about?
Kevin Breel	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Comedian, activist	Confessions of a depressed comic	1,929,294	11:00	Kevin Breel didn't look like a depressed kid: team captain, at every party, funny and confident. But he tells the story of the night he realized that — to save his own life — he needed to say four simple words.
James Flynn	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Moral philosopher	Why our IQ levels are higher than our grandparents'	2,101,554	18:40	It's called the "Flynn effect" — the fact that each generation scores higher on an IQ test than the generation before it. Are we actually getting smarter, or just thinking differently? In this fast-paced spin through the cognitive history of the 20th century, moral philosopher James Flynn suggests that changes in the way we think have had surprising (and not always positive) consequences.
Onora O'Neill	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Philosopher	What we don't understand about trust	1,263,647	9:50	Trust is on the decline, and we need to rebuild it. That’s a commonly heard suggestion for making a better world … but, says philosopher Onora O’Neill, we don’t really understand what we're suggesting. She flips the question, showing us that our three most common ideas about trust are actually misdirected. (Filmed at TEDxHousesofParliament.)
Stuart Firestein	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Neuroscientist	The pursuit of ignorance	1,558,216	18:33	What does real scientific work look like? As neuroscientist Stuart Firestein jokes: It looks a lot less like the scientific method and a lot more like "farting around … in the dark." In this witty talk, Firestein gets to the heart of science as it is really practiced and suggests that we should value what we don’t know — or “high-quality ignorance” — just as much as what we know.
Elizabeth Loftus	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	False memories scholar	How reliable is your memory?	2,357,448	17:36	Psychologist Elizabeth Loftus studies memories. More precisely, she studies false memories, when people either remember things that didn't happen or remember them differently from the way they really were. It's more common than you might think, and Loftus shares some startling stories and statistics — and raises some important ethical questions.
Benjamin Barber	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Political theorist	Why mayors should rule the world	656,685	18:05	It often seems like federal-level politicians care more about creating gridlock than solving the world's problems. So who's actually getting bold things done? City mayors. So, political theorist Benjamin Barber suggests: Let's give them more control over global policy. Barber shows how these "urban homeboys" are solving pressing problems on their own turf — and maybe in the world.
Andras Forgacs	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Bioprinting entrepreneur	Leather and meat without killing animals	935,506	9:02	By 2050, it will take 100 billion land animals to provide the world's population with meat, dairy, eggs and leather goods. Maintaining this herd will take a huge, potentially unsustainable toll on the planet. What if there were a different way? In this eye-opening talk, tissue engineering advocate Andras Forgacs argues that biofabricating meat and leather is a civilized way to move past killing animals for hamburgers and handbags.

Marla Spivak	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Bees scholar	Why bees are disappearing	1,853,918	15:57	Honeybees have thrived for 50 million years, each colony 40 to 50,000 individuals coordinated in amazing harmony. So why, seven years ago, did colonies start dying en masse? Marla Spivak reveals four reasons which are interacting with tragic consequences. This is not simply a problem because bees pollinate a third of the world’s crops. Could this incredible species be holding up a mirror for us?
James Lyne	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Cybersecurity specialist	Everyday cybercrime — and what you can do about it	1,037,035	17:26	How do you pick up a malicious online virus, the kind of malware that snoops on your data and taps your bank account? Often, it's through simple things you do each day without thinking twice. James Lyne reminds us that it's not only the NSA that's watching us, but ever-more-sophisticated cybercriminals, who exploit both weak code and trusting human nature.
Apollo Robbins	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Gentleman thief	The art of misdirection	7,772,528	8:47	Hailed as the greatest pickpocket in the world, Apollo Robbins studies the quirks of human behavior as he steals your watch. In a hilarious demonstration, Robbins samples the buffet of the TEDGlobal 2013 audience, showing how the flaws in our perception make it possible to swipe a wallet and leave it on its owner’s shoulder while they remain clueless.

It’s more than just a problem of medicine, says journalist Sonia Shah. A look into the history of malaria reveals three big-picture challenges to its eradication. Photos: Adam Nadel.
Ron McCallum	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Labor lawyer and activist	How technology allowed me to read	585,759	15:44	Months after he was born, in 1948, Ron McCallum became blind. In this charming, moving talk, he shows how he is able to read — and celebrates the progression of clever tools and adaptive computer technologies that make it possible. With their help, and that of generous volunteers, he's become a lawyer, an academic, and, most of all, a voracious reader. Welcome to the blind reading revolution. (Filmed at TEDxSydney.)
Jake Barton	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Designer and storyteller	The museum of you	709,216	15:38	A third of the world watched live as the World Trade Center collapsed on September 11, 2001; a third more heard about it within 24 hours. (Do you remember where you were?) So exhibits at the soon-to-open 9/11 Memorial Museum will reflect the diversity of the world's experiences of that day. In a moving talk, designer Jake Barton gives a peek at some of those installations, as well as several other projects that aim to make the observer an active participant in the exhibit.
George Monbiot	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Rewilding campaigner	For more wonder, rewild the world	730,156	15:10	Wolves were once native to the US' Yellowstone National Park — until hunting wiped them out. But when, in 1995, the wolves began to come back (thanks to an aggressive management program), something interesting happened: the rest of the park began to find a new, more healthful balance. In a bold thought experiment, George Monbiot imagines a wilder world in which humans work to restore the complex, lost natural food chains that once surrounded us.
Alexa Meade	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Visual artist	Your body is my canvas	2,287,116	7:04	Alexa Meade takes an innovative approach to art. Not for her a life of sketching and stretching canvases. Instead, she selects a topic and then paints it—literally. She covers everything in a scene—people, chairs, food, you name it—in a mask of paint that mimics what's below it. In this eye-opening talk Meade shows off photographs of some of the more outlandish results, and shares a new project involving people, paint and milk.
Chrystia Freeland	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Plutocracy chronicler	The rise of the new global super-rich	1,543,383	15:24	Technology is advancing in leaps and bounds — and so is economic inequality, says writer Chrystia Freeland. In an impassioned talk, she charts the rise of a new class of plutocrats (those who are extremely powerful because they are extremely wealthy), and suggests that globalization and new technology are actually fueling, rather than closing, the global income gap. Freeland lays out three problems with plutocracy … and one glimmer of hope.
Kelly McGonigal	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Health psychologist	How to make stress your friend	8,212,142	14:28	Stress. It makes your heart pound, your breathing quicken and your forehead sweat. But while stress has been made into a public health enemy, new research suggests that stress may only be bad for you if you believe that to be the case. Psychologist Kelly McGonigal urges us to see stress as a positive, and introduces us to an unsung mechanism for stress reduction: reaching out to others.
Adam Spencer	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Science communicator	Why I fell in love with monster prime numbers	1,634,012	17:17	They're millions of digits long, and it takes an army of mathematicians and machines to hunt them down — what's not to love about monster primes? Adam Spencer, comedian and lifelong math geek, shares his passion for these odd numbers, and for the mysterious magic of math.
May El-Khalil	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Founder of the Beirut Marathon	Making peace is a marathon	5,059,236	10:16	In Lebanon there is one gunshot a year that isn’t part of a scene of routine violence: The opening sound of the Beirut International Marathon. In a moving talk, marathon founder May El-Khalil explains why she believed a 26.2-mile running event could bring together a country divided for decades by politics and religion, even if for one day a year.
Steve Ramirez and Xu Liu	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Neuroscientist	A mouse. A laser beam. A manipulated memory.	880,388	15:25	Can we edit the content of our memories? It’s a sci-fi-tinged question that Steve Ramirez and Xu Liu are asking in their lab at MIT. Essentially, the pair shoot a laser beam into the brain of a living mouse to activate and manipulate its memory. In this unexpectedly amusing talk they share not only how, but — more importantly — why they do this. (Filmed at TEDxBoston.)
Russell Foster	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Circadian neuroscientist	Why do we sleep?	5,137,177	21:46	Russell Foster is a circadian neuroscientist: He studies the sleep cycles of the brain. And he asks: What do we know about sleep? Not a lot, it turns out, for something we do with one-third of our lives. In this talk, Foster shares three popular theories about why we sleep, busts some myths about how much sleep we need at different ages — and hints at some bold new uses of sleep as a predictor of mental health.
Shigeru Ban	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Architect	Emergency shelters made from paper	1,342,572	11:42	Long before sustainability was a buzzword, Pritzker Prize-winning architect Shigeru Ban had begun his experiments with ecologically sound building materials such as cardboard tubes. His remarkable structures are often intended as temporary housing for disaster-struck nations such as Haiti, Rwanda, Japan. Yet often the buildings remain a beloved part of the landscape long after they have served their intended purpose. (Filmed at TEDxTokyo.)
Margaret Heffernan	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Management thinker	The dangers of "willful blindness"	1,170,324	14:38	Gayla Benefield was just doing her job — until she uncovered an awful secret about her hometown that meant its mortality rate was 80 times higher than anywhere else in the U.S. But when she tried to tell people about it, she learned an even more shocking truth: People didn’t want to know. In a talk that’s part history lesson, part call-to-action, Margaret Heffernan demonstrates the danger of "willful blindness" and praises ordinary people like Benefield who are willing to speak up. (Filmed at TEDxDanubia.)
Derek Paravicini and Adam Ockelford	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=11	Musician	In the key of genius	1,244,014	19:38	Born three and a half months prematurely, Derek Paravicini is blind and has severe autism. But with perfect pitch, innate talent and a lot of practice, he became an acclaimed concert pianist by the age of 10. Here, his longtime piano teacher, Adam Ockelford, explains his student’s unique relationship to music, while Paravicini shows how he has ripped up the "Chopsticks" rule book. (Filmed at TEDxWarwick.)
Eleanor Longden	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=12	Research psychologist	The voices in my head	2,931,857	14:17	To all appearances, Eleanor Longden was just like every other student, heading to college full of promise and without a care in the world. That was until the voices in her head started talking. Initially innocuous, these internal narrators became increasingly antagonistic and dictatorial, turning her life into a living nightmare. Diagnosed with schizophrenia, hospitalized, drugged, Longden was discarded by a system that didn't know how to help her. Longden tells the moving tale of her years-long journey back to mental health, and makes the case that it was through learning to listen to her voices that she was able to survive.
Saki Mafundikwa	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=12	Graphic designer	Ingenuity and elegance in ancient African alphabets	629,253	8:10	From simple alphabets to secret symbolic languages, graphic designer Saki Mafundikwa celebrates the many forms of written communication across the continent of Africa. He highlights the history and legacy that are embodied in written words and symbols, and urges African designers to draw on these graphic forms for fresh inspiration. It's summed up in his favorite Ghanaian glyph, Sankofa, which means "return and get it" — or "learn from the past."
Jinsop Lee	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=12	Multi-sense designer	Design for all 5 senses	1,187,233	9:03	Good design looks great, yes — but why shouldn't it also feel great, smell great and sound great? Designer Jinsop Lee (a TED Talent Search winner) shares his theory of 5-sense design, with a handy graph and a few examples. His hope: to inspire you to notice great multisensory experiences.
Daniel H. Cohen	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=12	Philosopher	For argument’s sake	1,160,972	9:35	Why do we argue? To out-reason our opponents, prove them wrong, and, most of all, to win! ... Right? Philosopher Daniel H. Cohen shows how our most common form of argument — a war in which one person must win and the other must lose — misses out on the real benefits of engaging in active disagreement. (Filmed at TEDxColbyCollege.)
Beardyman	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=12	Beatboxer and inventor	The polyphonic me	1,494,750	11:10	Frustrated by not being able to sing two notes at the same time, musical inventor Beardyman built a machine to allow him to create loops and layers from just the sounds he makes with his voice. Given that he can effortlessly conjure the sound of everything from crying babies to buzzing flies, not to mention mimic pretty much any musical instrument imaginable, that's a lot of different sounds. Sit back and let the wall of sound of this dazzling performance wash over you.
Peter van Manen	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=12	Electronic systems expert	How can Formula 1 racing help ... babies?	689,095	7:56	During a Formula 1 race, a car sends hundreds of millions of data points to its garage for real-time analysis and feedback.

Filmed right as controversy over her Broadway production of Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark was at its peak, she candidly describes the tensions inherent within her creative process, as she strives both to capture the essence of a story—and produce images and experiences unlike anything else.
Eli Beer	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=12	Life saver	The fastest ambulance? A motorcycle	993,531	10:44	As a young EMT on a Jerusalem ambulance, Eli Beer realized that, stuck in brutal urban traffic, they often arrived too late to help. So he organized a group of volunteer EMTs — many on foot — ready to drop everything and dash to save lives in their neighborhood. Today, United Hatzlah uses a smartphone app and a fleet of “ambucycles” to help nearby patients until an ambulance arrives. With an average response time of 3 minutes, last year, they treated 207,000 people in Israel. And the idea is going global.
Bastian Schaefer	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=12	Aircraft engineer	A 3D-printed jumbo jet?	993,350	5:58	Designer Bastian Schaefer shows off a speculative design for the future of jet planes, with a skeleton inspired by strong, flexible, natural forms and by the needs of the world's, ahem, growing population.

Paul Kemp-Robertson	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=12	Advertising expert	Bitcoin. Sweat. Tide. Meet the future of branded currency.	887,961	10:51	Currency — the bills and coins you carry in your wallet and in your bank account — is founded on marketing, on the belief that banks and governments are trustworthy. Now, Paul Kemp-Robertson walks us through a new generation of currency, supported by that same marketing … but on behalf of a private brand. From Nike Sweat Points to bottles of Tide (which are finding an unexpected use in illegal markets), meet the non-bank future of currencies.
Roberto D'Angelo + Francesca Fedeli	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=12	Parents	In our baby's illness, a life lesson	862,352	6:17	Roberto D'Angelo and Francesca Fedeli thought their baby boy Mario was healthy — until at 10 days old, they discovered he'd had a perinatal stroke. With Mario unable to control the left side of his body, they grappled with tough questions: Would he be "normal?” Could he live a full life? The poignant story of parents facing their fears — and how they turned them around.
Kate Stone	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=12	Shepherd of electrons	DJ decks made of... paper	643,454	11:45	"I love paper, and I love technology," says physicist and former sheep herder Kate Stone, who's spent the past decade working to unite the two.

John Searle	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=12	Philosopher	Our shared condition — consciousness	1,146,902	14:59	Philosopher John Searle lays out the case for studying human consciousness — and systematically shoots down some of the common objections to taking it seriously. As we learn more about the brain processes that cause awareness, accepting that consciousness is a biological phenomenon is an important first step. And no, he says, consciousness is not a massive computer simulation. (Filmed at TEDxCERN.)

Bernie Krause	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=12	Natural sounds expert	The voice of the natural world	860,287	14:48	Bernie Krause has been recording wild soundscapes — the wind in the trees, the chirping of birds, the subtle sounds of insect larvae — for 45 years. In that time, he has seen many environments radically altered by humans, sometimes even by practices thought to be environmentally safe. A surprising look at what we can learn through nature's symphonies, from the grunting of a sea anemone to the sad calls of a beaver in mourning.
Al Vernacchio	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=12	Sexuality educator	Sex needs a new metaphor. Here's one ...	1,366,589	8:21	For some reason, says educator Al Vernacchio, the metaphors for talking about sex in the US all come from baseball — scoring, getting to first base, etc. The problem is, this frames sex as a competition, with a winner and a loser. Instead, he suggests a new metaphor, one that's more about shared pleasure, discussion and agreement, fulfillment and enjoyment. Let's talk about … pizza.
Jack Andraka	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=12	Cancer detector inventor	A promising test for pancreatic cancer ... from a teenager	3,907,753	10:49	Over 85 percent of all pancreatic cancers are diagnosed late, when someone has less than two percent chance of survival.

Michael Green	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=12	Architect	Why we should build wooden skyscrapers	1,020,831	12:22	Building a skyscraper? Forget about steel and concrete, says architect Michael Green, and build it out of … wood. As he details in this intriguing talk, it's not only possible to build safe wooden structures up to 30 stories tall (and, he hopes, higher), it's necessary.
Charmian Gooch	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=12	Anti-corruption activist	Meet global corruption's hidden players	1,377,313	14:27	When the son of the president of a desperately poor country starts buying mansions and sportscars on an official monthly salary of $7,000, Charmian Gooch suggests, corruption is probably somewhere in the picture. In a blistering, eye-opening talk (and through several specific examples), she details how global corruption trackers follow the money — to some surprisingly familiar faces.
Sleepy Man Banjo Boys	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=12	Bluegrass musicians	Bluegrass virtuosity from ... New Jersey?	2,435,881	8:47	All under the age of 16, brothers Jonny, Robbie and Tommy Mizzone are from New Jersey, a US state that's better known for the rock of Bruce Springsteen than the bluegrass of Earl Scruggs. Nonetheless, the siblings began performing bluegrass covers, as well as their own compositions, at a young age. Here, they play three dazzling songs in three different keys, passing the lead back and forth from fiddle to banjo to guitar.
Jinha Lee	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=12	Interface designer, engineer	Reach into the computer and grab a pixel	1,486,543	5:07	The border between our physical world and the digital information surrounding us has been getting thinner and thinner.

Joel Selanikio	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=12	Health and technology activist	The surprising seeds of a big-data revolution in healthcare	599,048	16:18	Collecting global health data was an imperfect science: Workers tramped through villages to knock on doors and ask questions, wrote the answers on paper forms, then input the data — and from this gappy information, countries would make huge decisions. Data geek Joel Selanikio talks through the sea change in collecting health data in the past decade — starting with the Palm Pilot and Hotmail, and now moving into the cloud. (Filmed at TEDxAustin.)
Eric X. Li	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=12	Investor and political scientist	A tale of two political systems	2,096,976	20:37	It's a standard assumption in the West: As a society progresses, it eventually becomes a capitalist, multi-party democracy. Right? Eric X. Li, a Chinese investor and political scientist, begs to differ. In this provocative, boundary-pushing talk, he asks his audience to consider that there's more than one way to run a successful modern nation.
Rodney Brooks	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=12	Roboticist	Why we will rely on robots	1,209,168	9:56	Scaremongers play on the idea that robots will simply replace people on the job. In fact, they can become our essential collaborators, freeing us up to spend time on less mundane and mechanical challenges. Rodney Brooks points out how valuable this could be as the number of working-age adults drops and the number of retirees swells. He introduces us to Baxter, the robot with eyes that move and arms that react to touch, which could work alongside an aging population — and learn to help them at home, too.
Michael Archer	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=12	Paleontologist	How we'll resurrect the gastric brooding frog, the Tasmanian tiger	483,117	17:36	The gastric brooding frog lays its eggs just like any other frog — then swallows them whole to incubate. That is, it did until it went extinct 30 years ago. Paleontologist Michael Archer makes a case to bring back the gastric brooding frog and the thylacine, commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger. (Filmed at TEDxDeExtinction.)

Peter Attia	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=12	Surgeon	Is the obesity crisis hiding a bigger problem?	2,039,439	15:58	As a young surgeon, Peter Attia felt contempt for a patient with diabetes. She was overweight, he thought, and thus responsible for the fact that she needed a foot amputation. But years later, Attia received an unpleasant medical surprise that led him to wonder: is our understanding of diabetes right? Could the precursors to diabetes cause obesity, and not the other way around? A look at how assumptions may be leading us to wage the wrong medical war.
Lesley Hazleton	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=12	Accidental theologist	The doubt essential to faith	1,110,348	13:45	When Lesley Hazleton was writing a biography of Muhammad, she was struck by something: The night he received the revelation of the Koran, according to early accounts, his first reaction was doubt, awe, even fear. And yet this experience became the bedrock of his belief. Hazleton calls for a new appreciation of doubt and questioning as the foundation of faith — and an end to fundamentalism of all kinds.
Camille Seaman	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=12	Photographer	Photos from a storm chaser	1,281,719	3:26	Photographer Camille Seaman has been chasing storms for 5 years. In this talk she shows stunning, surreal photos of the heavens in tumult.

Daniel Suarez	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=13	Sci-fi author	The kill decision shouldn't belong to a robot	1,851,641	13:20	As a novelist, Daniel Suarez spins dystopian tales of the future. But on the TEDGlobal stage, he talks us through a real-life scenario we all need to know more about: the rise of autonomous robotic weapons of war. Advanced drones, automated weapons and AI-powered intelligence-gathering tools, he suggests, could take the decision to make war out of the hands of humans.

We need a Plan B	1,109,708	12:31	The Internet connects billions of people and machines; it's the backbone of modern life. But tech pioneer Danny Hillis thinks the Internet just wasn't designed to grow this big — and he fears that one big cyber-attack or glitch could shut it down and take civilization with it. To head off a digital dark age, he sounds a clarion call to develop a Plan B: a parallel system to fall back on if — or when — the Internet crashes.

(Filmed at TEDxCaltech.)
Dan Pallotta	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=15	Charity defender	The way we think about charity is dead wrong	3,510,148	18:54	Activist and fundraiser Dan Pallotta calls out the double standard that drives our broken relationship to charities. Too many nonprofits, he says, are rewarded for how little they spend — not for what they get done. Instead of equating frugality with morality, he asks us to start rewarding charities for their big goals and big accomplishments (even if that comes with big expenses). In this bold talk, he says: Let's change the way we think about changing the world.

But — then what? In their first elections, Libyans tried an innovative slate of candidates, the "zipper ballot," that ensured equal representation from men and women of both sides. Yet the same gridlocked politics of dominance and exclusion won out. What Libya needs now, Langhi suggests, is collaboration, not competition; compassion, not rage.

Richard Weller	https://www.ted.com/talks?page=16	Dermatologist	Could the sun be good for your heart?	829,101	12:59	Our bodies get Vitamin D from the sun, but as dermatologist Richard Weller suggests, sunlight may confer another surprising benefit too. New research by his team shows that nitric oxide, a chemical transmitter stored in huge reserves in the skin, can be released by UV light, to great benefit for blood pressure and the cardiovascular system. What does it mean? Well, it might begin to explain why Scots get sick more than Australians ...
